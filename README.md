## CS-4100(Artificial Intelligence) Final Project


Final Project for Northeastern's CS4100 course
The goal of this project is to attempt to solve the Wikipedia Game in multiple different ways, and compare them.
The Wikipedia Game is a game where a starting Wikipedia encyclopedia page is defined, and the goal is to, via only links to other Wikipedia encyclopedia pages, navigate to a set goal page, also within Wikipedia.

This theoretically can be neatly solved with a graph-search, specifically A* search, but the problem lies with finding a consistent heuristic for that purpose...
