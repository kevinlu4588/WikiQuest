# Wikipedia-Game-Solver-CS4100

- Final Project for Northeastern's CS4100 course
- The goal of this project is to attempt to solve the Wikipedia Game in multiple different ways, and compare them.


The Wikipedia Game is a game where a starting Wikipedia encyclopedia page is defined, 
and the goal is to, via only links to other Wikipedia encyclopedia pages, navigate to a set goal page, also within Wikipedia.

This theoretically can be neatly solved with a graph-search, specifically A* search, but the problem lies with finding a consistent heuristic for that purpose...
